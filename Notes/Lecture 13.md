### Software Design and Development

#### Transition from Requirements to Design
- **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding what the system is supposed to do.
- **Design Approach**: Determining the necessary software to meet those requirements.

#### The Design Problem
- **Complex Requirements**: A lengthy requirements document does not directly translate into software components.
- **Team Collaboration**: Software development is a team effort, not an individual task.
- **Component Breakdown**: Requirements are divided into components, which could be classes, HTML pages, CSS, or XML elements.

#### Software Components Allocation
- **Priority and Dependencies**: Important components are developed first, considering dependencies among them.
- **Software Complexity**: The software should be easy to understand, test, and develop.

#### Code Characteristics
- **Length**: Classes and methods should be concise.
- **Flexibility**: Code must be adaptable for future modifications.
- **Reusability**: Effective use of Object-Oriented (OO) inheritance enhances code reusability.

#### Abstraction and Real-World Modeling
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex real-world scenarios into software models.
- **Case Study**: Practical examples to illustrate abstraction.

#### Design and Implementation Overlap
- **Iterative Process**: Design and coding are interwoven, with continuous updates to design documents.

#### Understanding the Problem
- **Boundary Diagrams**: Distinguishing between internal and external system components.
- **Integration with External Services**: Leveraging existing web services to reduce development workload.

#### Solution Description Techniques
- **Noun Identification Technique**: Identifying components for development.
- **Class Diagrams**: Depicting the static structure of data and code.
- **Interaction Diagrams**: Illustrating dynamic interactions within the code.

#### System Architecture and OO Design
- **Architectural Components**: The main building blocks of the system.
- **OO Design**: Integrating component, data structure, and algorithm design in an object-oriented approach.

#### Modular Programming
- **Procedural Abstraction**: Simplifying complex functions into smaller subprocesses.
- **Functional Programming**: Ensuring consistent output for given inputs, beneficial for tasks requiring regular data transformation.

#### Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
- **Objects and Properties**: Objects contain data (state) and interact through message passing.
- **Advantages of OOD**: Promotes code reuse and stability, and models the real world effectively.

#### Modular Design Criteria
- **Decomposability**: Breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
- **Composability**: Creating modules that can be combined to form new systems.
- **Understandability**: Developing self-commenting code for clarity.
- **Continuity**: Small requirement changes should lead to minimal code alterations.
- **Protection**: Modules should handle abnormal conditions without widespread impact.

#### Data Persistence and Repository Models
- **Persistence**: Storing data for retrieval after system restarts.
- **Repository Model**: Centralized data storage, often implemented as databases.
- **Subsystem Independence**: Each subsystem may have its own database, useful in embedded systems.

#### Coupling and Data Storage
- **Stamp Coupling**: A potential risk in repository models where modules are overly dependent on a central data format.
- **Data Backup and Security**: Centralized data allows for efficient backup and security management.

#### Conclusion
- **Key Concepts**: Review of decomposability, composability, understandability, continuity, and module protection.
- **Next Steps**: Further discussion on design in upcoming lectures.
