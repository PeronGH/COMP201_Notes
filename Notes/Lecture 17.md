### Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

#### Overview of OOD
Object-Oriented Design (OOD) encompasses two main components: **Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)** and **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)**. OOA focuses on identifying the names and relationships of classes, while OOD is concerned with defining the attributes, methods, and responsibilities of classes. Together, they structure code into a collection of objects that define both the data and behavior of the code.

#### Data-Driven vs. Responsibility-Driven Design
OOD can be approached from two perspectives:
- **Data-Driven Design**: Prioritizes the data aspect of objects.
- **Responsibility-Driven Design**: Concentrates on the responsibilities and behaviors of objects.

For example, in a fire alarm system:
- **Data-Driven**: A card object storing data such as pin numbers.
- **Responsibility-Driven**: A fire detector object tasked with detecting fires.

#### Principles of Good OOD
Good OOD aims to achieve loose coupling and high coherence within the system. It involves understanding the nature of objects, their interfaces, and how they communicate with each other. Key concepts include:
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Dynamic Binding**

These concepts are revisited in depth in software engineering courses, particularly the SOLID principles of OOD.

#### Understanding Objects
An object is defined by three main characteristics:
- **Behavior**: Defined by the object's methods and internal code.
- **Internal State**: The values of the object's attributes or variables.
- **Identity**: The unique reference to the object in memory.

Objects encapsulate their state and behavior, promoting secure data storage and independence from other objects. This encapsulation allows for data privacy and control over how data within an object is modified.

#### Object Interfaces and Identity
Objects have both public and private interfaces. The public interface consists of methods that can be called on the object, while the private interface includes additional methods accessible within the object's scope or package. In Java, there are also package-private and protected interfaces for more granular access control.

#### Classifications and Classes
Objects sharing the same data structure and operations are grouped into classes. Classes provide type protection and define not only the data stored but also the operations an object can perform. They can be used as reusable components if designed with loose coupling and high reusability.

#### Inheritance and Polymorphism
Inheritance allows for the creation of specialized objects by extending a base class, adding new attributes and operations without altering the original class. Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their superclass, reducing code duplication and increasing flexibility.

#### Dynamic Binding
Dynamic binding determines the method to call at runtime based on the object's actual type in memory. This feature allows for more dynamic and adaptable code execution.

#### Unified Modeling Language (UML)
UML is a collection of notations that facilitate the design and visualization of OOD. It includes class diagrams, state charts, and interaction diagrams, among others, to represent the structure and relationships of objects and classes.

#### CASE Tools and UML
Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools assist in modeling, code generation, and design analysis. They support UML design and can help translate designs across different programming languages.

#### Conclusion
OOD is a methodology that structures code into objects with well-defined interfaces, promoting reusability and adaptability. The use of UML and CASE tools aids in the design process, ensuring that objects can be effectively used in new projects and adapted to changes. The next session will focus on a case study involving OOD for a hotel requirement.
