### Wrapping Up Security Requirements Discussion

#### Confidentiality
- **Methods:** Encryption, key length consideration, quantum computing security.
- **Challenges:** Balancing future-proof encryption with practical constraints.

#### Integrity
- **Ensuring message accuracy:** 
   - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for accidental errors.
   - Hashing functions with shared secrets.
   - Asymmetric ciphers for secure communication.
- **Challenges:** Protecting against intentional alterations.

#### Authentication and Authorization
- **Username and Password Issues:** Risk of interception, need for secure channels.
- **Solutions:** Diffie-Hellman protocol for key exchange, public key infrastructure.
- **Challenges:** Establishing secure communication without shared secrets initially.

#### Non-repudiation
- **Ensuring accountability:** 
   - Digital signatures with timestamps.
   - Third-party servers for message storage.
   - Linking to blockchain for transactional integrity.
- **Applications:** Financial transactions, contract agreements.

#### Availability
- **Defining uptime standards:** Measured in "nines" (e.g., 99.9999% uptime).
- **Challenges:** Balancing high availability with worst-case scenarios.

#### Audits and Logs
- **Purpose:** Monitoring unusual activities (e.g., failed logins, large transactions).
- **Applications:** Banking systems, sensitive data handling.
- **Challenges:** Interpreting logs for security threats while maintaining service quality.

#### Bell-LaPadula Model
- **Security framework:** For document and data classification.
- **Principles:** No-read-up, no-write-down, trusted subjects for declassification.
- **Applications:** Government, military data security.

#### Verifying Requirements
- **Ensuring requirements are:** 
   - Valid, consistent, complete, realistic.
   - Verifiable (e.g., through automated testing).

#### Scenarios and Testing
- **Linking scenarios to use cases:** For targeted testing.
- **Tools like Cucumber:** Using Gherkin language for test case generation.

#### Next Steps
- Review of remaining slides and further discussions in the next session.
- Continued focus on practical applications of these security principles.
