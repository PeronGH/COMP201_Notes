### Requirements Engineering: Security Requirements Focus

#### Overview
- **Objective:** Explore security requirements in systems design.
- **Key Areas:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, Authorization, Non-repudiation, Availability.

#### Confidentiality
- **Description:** Ensuring data privacy up to a reasonable future point.
- **Application:** Encrypting data with a lifespan in mind (e.g., credit card data, personal information).
- **Challenge:** Absolute confidentiality is challenging; focus on time-bound security.

#### Integrity
- **Description:** Ensuring data accuracy and preventing unauthorized alterations.
- **Application:** Email or message integrity checks.
- **Challenge:** Data can be altered but should not go undetected.

#### Authentication and Authorization
- **Authentication:** Verifying user identity (e.g., login credentials).
- **Authorization:** Controlling access based on user identity (e.g., permissions for different user roles).
- **Application:** Different system access levels for hotel management system users.
- **Challenge:** Balancing ease of use with robust security protocols.

#### Non-repudiation
- **Description:** Ensuring actions or communications cannot be denied later.
- **Application:** Financial transactions, contract agreements.
- **Challenge:** Providing irrefutable proof of actions in digital communications.

#### Availability
- **Description:** Ensuring system remains operational and accessible.
- **Application:** Critical in safety systems, financial services like ATMs.
- **Challenge:** Maintaining 24/7 service availability.

#### Ethnography in Requirements Engineering
- **Traditional Ethnography:** Observing how people interact in their natural work environment.
- **Focused Ethnography:** Using prototypes to observe interactions with new systems.
- **Application:** Understanding air traffic control operations.
- **Benefits:** Captures subtle social and organizational dynamics often missed in interviews.

#### Approach to Stakeholder Interviews
- **Closed Interviews:** Structured questions to gather specific information.
- **Open Interviews/Focus Groups:** More flexible, open-ended discussions.
- **Challenges:** Ensuring comprehensive stakeholder representation and capturing nuanced needs.

#### Next Steps
- **Feasibility Study:** Assessing project viability based on objectives, technology, cost, and integration.
- **Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:** Gathering, reviewing, and refining requirements.
- **Requirements Validation:** Ensuring requirements align with user needs and expectations.
- **Requirements Management:** Adapting to changes over time, annual reviews.

#### Upcoming Focus
- Further exploration of the key security areas in the next session.
- Detailed discussion on how to provide and enhance these security aspects in system design.
