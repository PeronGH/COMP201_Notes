### Understanding Software Requirements

#### Overview
- **Focus:** Understanding software requirements, including the distinction between user and system requirements, and functional versus non-functional requirements.

#### Importance of Software Requirements
- **Defect Amplification:** Small inaccuracies in requirements can lead to significant software issues.
- **Requirement Types:** User and system requirements; functional and non-functional requirements.

#### User vs. System Requirements
- **User Requirements:** High-level descriptions in natural language for customers.
- **System Requirements:** Detailed, technical specifications for developers.

#### Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:** Describe what the system should do (e.g., spell-checking a document).
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Describe system properties and constraints (e.g., performance metrics, security standards).

#### Examples of Requirements Evolution
- **Iteration:** Refining requirements from general to specific.
- **Example:** Evolving the specification for a spell-checking feature from a general goal to detailed software specifications.

#### Challenges in Defining Requirements
- **Ambiguity:** Vague requirements can lead to different interpretations.
- **Conflict:** Potential conflicts between requirements (e.g., ease of use vs. security).

#### Types of Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Product Requirements:** Reliability, usability, efficiency.
2. **Organizational Requirements:** Development standards, policies.
3. **External Requirements:** Legal compliance, interoperability.

#### Distinguishing Requirements
- **Use of Language:** Using terms like "shall," "should," and "may" to differentiate between mandatory, recommended, and optional requirements.
- **Self-Contained Documents:** Minimizing jargon, ensuring clarity.

#### Key Takeaways
- **User Requirements:** For customers, less technical.
- **System Requirements:** For developers, highly technical.
- **Functional Requirements:** Services provided by the system.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** How those services are provided or constraints on the system.
- **Importance of Clarity and Precision:** To ensure effective implementation and testing.
