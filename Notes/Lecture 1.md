### Introduction to Software Engineering

#### Module Overview
- **Instructor:** Sebastian Coop, assisted by Henry.
- **Focus:** Building large-scale systems in software engineering.
- **Key Areas:** Requirements, design, testing, and project management.
- **Resources:** Materials available on Canvas, including lectures, tutorials, source code, and links.

#### Understanding Software Engineering
- **Software Composition:** Combination of code and data.
  - Example: Neural nets require weights and data to function.
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OO): Integration of data (attributes) and code (methods).
- **Software Engineering Approach:** Structured and disciplined, not random or haphazard.
- **Complexity Management:** Breaking down large systems into smaller, manageable units.
- **Risk of Failure:** Serious implications in safety-critical systems like Tesla's self-drive function.

#### Module Content Breakdown
1. **Requirements Engineering:** Understanding what the product should do.
2. **Design:** Focusing on user interface, software internal design, data organization, and database structures.
3. **Coding and Testing:** Iterative process of development and validation.
4. **Project Management:** Managing the process and anticipating challenges.

#### Practical Work and Assignments
- **Seminar/Tutorial:** Starting from the following week.
- **Assignments:** Three parts, focusing on user case analysis, UML modeling, and a small programming task.
- **Examination:** Multiple choice test, in-person.

#### Recommended Textbooks
