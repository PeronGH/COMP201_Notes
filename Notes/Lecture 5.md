### Use Case Analysis in Software Engineering

#### Overview
- **Focus:** Understanding use case analysis in software engineering, particularly for coursework 1.1.
- **Topics:** Essentials of use case analysis and its relevance to functional and non-functional requirements.

#### Understanding Use Cases
- **Use Case:** An interaction or task performed by an actor (user) with the system.
- **Actor:** Can be human (e.g., customer, engineer) or non-human (e.g., payment service, sensor).
- **External Perspective:** Use cases describe system usage from the user's point of view, not internal operations.

#### Types of Actors
- **Human Actors:** Examples include customers, game players, or drivers.
- **Non-Human Actors:** Examples include smoke detectors, email servers, or external services like PayPal.

#### Use Case Descriptions
- **Content:** Details what the use case does, including success and alternate scenarios.
- **Example:** "Print Receipt" use case, outlining the process and alternative outcomes.

#### Representing Use Cases
- **Actors:** Represented by stick figures.
- **Use Cases:** Represented by ellipses.
- **Interactions:** Shown by arrows connecting actors and use cases.

#### Example: ATM Machine Use Case
- **Actors:** Customer, bank staff, service engineer.
- **Use Cases:** Withdraw cash, check balance, add cash, check security video recording.
- **Visualization:** Actors are outside the system boundary; use cases are inside.

#### Importance of Use Cases
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Should describe all possible interactions with the system.
- **Utility Focus:** Each use case must provide value or utility to the users.
- **System Boundary:** Distinguishes between what's inside (use cases) and outside (actors) the system.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Use Cases as Requirements:** They form a crucial part of functional requirements.
- **Scenarios and Actors:** Understanding different scenarios and identifying relevant actors.
- **Use Case Diagrams:** Essential for visualizing interactions between actors and the system.

### Next Steps
- Apply these concepts in identifying and developing use cases for coursework 1.1.
- Focus on creating clear and comprehensive use case diagrams.
- Prepare for the next session on a case study and review the case study material on Canvas.
