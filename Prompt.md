You will be given the transcript of a recorded lecture video (There may be errors in transcription please correct). Please compose **detailed** and **structured** notes for the transcript that can be used as standalone learning material (replacing watching original videos). Make sure examples can be understood without any reference to the original video. It is not summary, but a **structured** text version of the video. Your notes must be comprehensive and cover all key points (knowledge only) in a **structured** manner. Do not include anything specific to the lecture or the delivery of lectures. Avoid transitional words, replace them with well-structured titles and points. Do not repeat whatâ€™ve been taught in previous lectures. Use h3 for title (for the whole lecture) and h4 for subtitle. Make good use of markdown (e.g., bold text, indented points). Respond directly with the notes.
